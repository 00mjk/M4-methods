Download the data files named "m4alldata.csv" and "m4fullseasonality.csv" from "http://194.27.66.16/tez/m4/m4-data/" and save them in your computer. Extract the ATADamped.rar file and install the program. Click on the data file inbox and select the "m4alldata.csv" from your folder. Then click on the seasonal indexes inbox and select the "m4fullseasonality.csv" file. Click on the run button and enter a name for your output file. If you would like to use the program to generate forecasts for another data set, make sure your data and seasonality index files are in the same format as the aforementioned data files. Alternatively, you can use ATA-Damped_R file in programme R.
